I'll help you troubleshoot the issue with saving assets with attached images. Looking at your code and rules, I can see the problem might be in how the image upload and Firestore saving are coordinated.

Based on the information you've shared, here's what might be happening:

1. Your form is working correctly when no image is added (direct save to Firestore)
2. When an image is uploaded, something is failing in the process of:
   - Uploading the image to Firebase Storage
   - Getting the URL of the uploaded image
   - Including that URL in the Firestore document
   - Completing the save operation

Let me suggest a solution that should fix this issue:

```javascript
// Image upload helper function
const uploadImage = async (file, userId) => {
  if (!file) return null;
  
  // Create a unique filename
  const fileName = `${new Date().getTime()}_${file.name}`;
  const storageRef = ref(storage, `logos/${userId}/${fileName}`);
  
  try {
    // Upload the file
    const uploadTask = await uploadBytes(storageRef, file);
    // Get download URL
    const downloadURL = await getDownloadURL(uploadTask.ref);
    return downloadURL;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading image:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};

// Modified save function
const saveAsset = async (assetData, imageFile) => {
  try {
    // Show loading state
    setIsSubmitting(true);
    
    let finalAssetData = { ...assetData };
    
    // If there's an image file, upload it first
    if (imageFile) {
      const userId = auth.currentUser.uid;
      const imageUrl = await uploadImage(imageFile, userId);
      
      // Add the image URL to the asset data
      if (imageUrl) {
        finalAssetData.imageUrl = imageUrl;
      }
    }
    
    // Now save the complete asset data (with image URL if uploaded) to Firestore
    const assetRef = doc(collection(db, 'assets'));
    await setDoc(assetRef, {
      ...finalAssetData,
      createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
      updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
      userId: auth.currentUser.uid
    });
    
    // Reset form and close dialog
    resetForm();
    closeDialog();
    
    // Show success notification
    toast.success('Asset added successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error saving asset:", error);
    toast.error('Failed to add asset');
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};

// In your form submission handler
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Basic form validation
  if (!assetData.assetName || !assetData.type) {
    toast.error('Please fill in all required fields');
    return;
  }
  
  // Get the image file from your form (adjust based on your form structure)
  const imageFile = formRef.current.elements.imageUpload.files[0];
  
  // Call the saveAsset function with both asset data and image file
  await saveAsset(assetData, imageFile);
};
```

Make sure your form includes an input for the image:

```jsx
<input 
  type="file" 
  name="imageUpload" 
  accept="image/*" 
  onChange={handleImageChange} // Optional handler to preview the image
/>
```

Also, verify that your Firebase setup includes both Firestore and Storage:

```javascript
import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytes, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage";
import { getFirestore, doc, setDoc, collection, serverTimestamp } from "firebase/firestore";

// Initialize services
const db = getFirestore(app);
const storage = getStorage(app);
```

The key points in this solution:
1. Separate the image upload from the data saving
2. Upload the image first, get its URL
3. Then include that URL in the Firestore document data
4. Use try/catch to properly handle errors
5. Make sure the Firebase Storage rules are correctly set up (which yours appear to be)

This should fix your issue with saving assets that have attached images while maintaining all existing functionality.
