2. Firebase Authentication:
Implement Firebase Authentication to ensure only authenticated users can access the application.

Use Firebase Authentication to track the userId for each user, which will be used to enforce Firestore rules.

Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures (e.g., invalid credentials, network issues).

3. Frontend Implementation:
Dynamic Input Fields:

Use React Hook Form for form management and validation.

Ensure all input fields are dynamic and correctly map to Firestore collections.

Implement proper state management for form data and user interactions.

Form Validation:

Use Zod schema validation for all forms to ensure data integrity before sending it to Firestore.

File Uploads:

Implement secure file uploads for documents, logos, and asset photos using Firebase Storage.

Ensure file size and type validation on the frontend and backend.

Real-Time Updates:

Use Firestoreâ€™s real-time listeners (onSnapshot) to keep the UI updated with the latest data.

4. Backend Integration:
Firebase Initialization:

Initialize Firebase in your React application with proper environment variables for API keys and configuration.

CRUD Operations:

Implement functions to fetch, save, update, and delete data from Firestore.

Ensure proper error handling and state management for loading, success, and error states.

Security:

Ensure all Firestore requests are authenticated and authorized using Firebase Authentication.

Use Firebase Security Rules to enforce data access controls.

5. Error Handling and Logging:
Implement proper error handling for Firestore operations (e.g., network errors, permission denied).

Log errors to a centralized logging service (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics or a custom logging solution).

6. Testing:
Test all CRUD operations thoroughly to ensure data is securely stored and retrieved.

Test Firestore rules to ensure users can only access their own data.

Test file uploads to ensure they are securely stored and linked to the correct Firestore documents.

Deliverables:
Firestore Collections:

Properly configured Firestore collections for each page (Assets, Vendors, Team, Documents, Business Profile).

Firestore Rules:

Secure Firestore rules enabling CRUD operations based on user ID.

Frontend Integration:

Dynamic input fields correctly mapped to Firestore collections.

Proper form validation using Zod and React Hook Form.

Real-time updates using Firestore listeners.

Backend Integration:

Firebase initialization with proper environment variables.

Functions for CRUD operations with proper error handling.

Security:

Firebase Authentication integrated with Firestore rules.

Secure file uploads using Firebase Storage.

Testing:

Comprehensive testing of all features, including edge cases and error scenarios.
